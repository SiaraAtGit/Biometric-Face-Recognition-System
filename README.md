# Biometric-Face-Recognition-System
The Biometric Face Recognition System is a real-time facial recognition application that leverages advanced image processing and machine learning techniques for user authentication. The system is designed for high accuracy and efficiency, using a combination of state-of-the-art libraries and algorithms.

Core Features:

Real-Time Face Detection:
Utilizes OpenCV for live video capture and face detection.
Employs Haar Cascades or HOG-based models for accurate face localization.
Supports detection of multiple faces simultaneously.

Facial Landmark Detection:
Detects key points (eyes, nose, mouth) to improve facial geometry understanding.
Enhances accuracy under variable conditions (lighting, pose).

Face Recognition:
Uses face_recognition with dlib to encode faces into 128-dimensional vectors.
Compares live face encodings against stored encodings for identity verification.
High-speed, scalable recognition using Euclidean distance for facial comparisons.

Face Database:
Manages a database of known face encodings for quick lookup.
Supports adding, updating, and removing user face data dynamically.

Optimized Performance:
Designed for low-latency, real-time operation.
Scalable to handle large datasets with minimal performance degradation.

Technology Stack:
>Python: Core programming language.
>OpenCV: For image/video processing and face detection.
>face_recognition/dlib: For face encoding and recognition.
>NumPy: For efficient matrix computations and data handling.
